  summary: Start all Butler tasks
  description: |
    This endpoint will attempt to start all Butler tasks that are enabled in the settings. Butler tasks normally run automatically during a time window configured on the server's Settings page but can be manually started using this endpoint. Tasks will run with the following criteria:
    1. Any tasks not scheduled to run on the current day will be skipped.
    2. If a task is configured to run at a random time during the configured window and we are outside that window, the task will start immediately.
    3. If a task is configured to run at a random time during the configured window and we are within that window, the task will be scheduled at a random time within the window.
    4. If we are outside the configured window, the task will start immediately.
